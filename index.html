        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Katrina is a hardworking individual who strives to incorporate listening, empathy, and logic to her challenges. Being a mom of three very busy and inquisitive children keeps her on her toes. She wears an extraordinary amount of hats each and every day. A non all inclusive list would look something like: alarm clock, drill sergeant, cook, maid, chauffer, meal planner, activities coordinator, crisis mediator, hostage negotiator, motivational speaker, medic, errand girl, and of course a hug guru. With google and some ice cream she is well equipped to handle just about anything.</p>
